Shelf Stats

Some people just love throwing a statistic on everything, even their hobbies. I'm one of those people. I'm building Shelf Stats to provide a visualization of my reading. Namely, via a visual "shelf" to display all the books I've read and a statistics dashboard to give me some nerdy statistics on my reading habit.
